## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment and configuration of a full Windows Server 2022 infrastructure in a simulated business environment using VMware. It includes Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy Objects (GPO), and a secured File Server.

The goal was to simulate a real-world IT environment with centralized user management, role-based access control, and secure network services.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Windows Server 2022**
- **Windows 10/11 Clients**
- **VMware Workstation**
- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**
- **DNS / DHCP**
- **Group Policy (GPO)**
- **File Server / NTFS Permissions**

---

## 🎯 Objectives Achieved

- ✅ Centralized user authentication using Active Directory  
- ✅ Role-based Organizational Units (OUs) and Groups  
- ✅ Automated IP management via DHCP  
- ✅ Domain-level name resolution with DNS  
- ✅ GPO enforcement (password policy, control panel restrictions, drive mapping)  
- ✅ Secure file sharing with NTFS and Share-level permissions

## 🗂️ Project Breakdown

### 🔹 Step 1: Rename the Server
Renamed the server to `DC01` to prepare for Domain Controller promotion.

### 🔹 Step 2: Static IP Setup
Configured a static IP: `192.168.1.10` for consistent DNS/DHCP service.

### 🔹 Step 3: Install AD DS Role
Installed and promoted the server to a Domain Controller with domain: `kalomba.local`.

### 🔹 Step 4: Create OUs, Users & Groups
Created `IT`, `HR`, `Sales` OUs. Created user accounts and added them to corresponding Security Groups.

### 🔹 Step 5: Install and Configure DHCP
Deployed DHCP role with a scope (192.168.1.100–192.168.1.200) and linked it to the domain.

### 🔹 Step 6: Group Policy Configuration
Used GPMC to apply security policies:
- Disabled Control Panel access for HR
- Enforced password complexity
- Mapped network drives

### 🔹 Step 7: File Server Setup
Created shared folders (`HR_Reports`, `Sales_Data`, etc.) with NTFS and Share permissions based on group access.
